# Markdown

This extension provides a YAML Text Formatter extending all other Symphony Formatters.
In the config it allows you to select the Symphony formatter you would like to use in addition to the YAML formatter.
If no formatter is selected the default Parsedown formatter is used.

## Output

The YAML output is appended to the field's XML where the HTML content would usually appear. 
So take note and do not output YAML in your HTML, just use it for meta data.
If you're not sure how to do this, look for the XSLT Ninja Technique.
